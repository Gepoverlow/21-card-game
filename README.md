# 21 Blackjack Game!

Check out the Live Version at https://gepoverlow.github.io/21-card-game/

## Encountered Difficulties

- Never played the game before so had to first learn it, understand it and then implement the logic.
- The value of the Ace card depending on the total value was a challenge.
- Finding a way to hide the last card of House.

## The Takeout

- Working OOP with classes was definately a good decision. It made everything much more logic and tidy. Would like to keep applying this way of developing in future projects as I am confident I learned a lot by using classes.
- Learned how to play 21 Blackjack!

## What the game can do

- Make Player and a House on page load.
- Make, reset and shuffle a Deck on initialization.
- You start with 10k credits and can choose between betting 1K, 2K or 3K before starting a new game. This value can go up or down through the multiple new games depending, of course, if you win or loose.
- Play the game as intended!
- On Win or Loose, go back to the betting stage.
- Re-initialize the game on restart.

## What the game can still not (yet) do

- Have multiple players simulaneously.
- Have the splitting functionality of the game.
- A Game Over (0 credits remaining) way of informing the player, and a way for him/her to keep playing without credits.
